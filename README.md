# Come Back to Tab

Do you ever start a build or other long-running process in a tab and forget
to come back to it, or just keep that tab open until it completes and forgo
the opportunity to get more work done? Never forget a tab with this extension!

Just click the extension icon or use the keyboard shortcut (by default Cmd+Shift+U
on MacOS and Ctrl+Shift+U elsewhere), enter a number of minutes for the reminder,
and press Enter. Then, that many minutes later, you'll get a notification to
return to your tab.
